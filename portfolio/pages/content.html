        <h1>You are on Basic Content </h1>
        <p>The last theme of the semester. In this theme, we did content for a real customer, Foodsharing Cph. The assignment was to create a campaign site for one of the issue they have. The first issue is how to reduce food waste. The other one is to have more volunteers because of the need for more people to help this organization. This was a group project where we choose focus on how to reduce food waste. Even is not looking good from the outside, but the inside can still be very nice. That out message to the target audience. Here is the idea we came up with. </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>On this last theme assignment, I got the chance to do other things than coding. Don't miss understand me, I still like coding, but this time I had the opportunity to edit video which is very nice because I haven't done that before. So I learned a lot about how to edit video. I also learned how to film clips and what to think about next time. It is not easy to shoot all the clips at one time, and sometimes you think you have enough clips, but when you look at all the films you have, you find out you need more or better ones. As a team project, it was very nice to work from everyone, whenever everyone does not agree, or we discuss a lot. Also, I learned a lot from my group members. Every time I work on a group project, I learn so much about collaboration and teamwork. I develop a lot of personal because I have to be professional when we discuss or have to agree on something. </p>
